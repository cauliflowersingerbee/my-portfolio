        Hi, Iâ€™m Okwiri, a writer, web developer and UX Designer. After years of working as a fiction writer, I've decided to venture into tech. I am skilled in JavaScript, Node.js, React, React Native, and Angular. I am also skilled in UX research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.  
Designing and creating stories is an important part of my writing work, something I approach with great care and thoughtfulness. I have found surprising similarities between story design and software design. The empathy and detail with which I craft my fiction characters, I now bring to my personas in the UX design process. The structure of narrative and the meticulousness of grammar, I now bring to the structure and syntax code. I am interested in building software that is human-centered, aesthetic, and useful.
